## Enabling the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project, you can use your favourite dependency management system.
If you are using Composer, you need to do one of the following:

Add the Yoti SDK dependency:

"require": {
    "yoti/yoti-php-sdk" : "^4.1"
}
```

Or run this Composer command
```console
$ composer require yoti/yoti-php-sdk "^4.1"
```

## Setup

For each service you will need:

* Your Client SDK ID, generated by [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com) when you create (and then publish) your app. 
* Your .pem file. This is your own unique private key which your browser generates from the [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com) when you create an application.
