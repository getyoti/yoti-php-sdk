## An Architectural View

To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in Yoti Dashboard when you create/update your application.

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate in the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out steps 6 through 9 for you, including profile decryption and communication with backend services.

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. By the way, your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for web and mobile clients.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.5.19
* CURL PHP extension (must support TLSv1.2)

## Enabling the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project, you can use your favourite dependency management system.
If you are using Composer, you need to do one of the following:

Add the Yoti SDK dependency:

```json
"require": {
    "yoti/yoti-php-sdk" : "2.0.*"
}
```

Or run this Composer command
```console
$ composer require yoti/yoti-php-sdk "2.0.*"
```

## Client Initialisation

The YotiClient is the SDK entry point. To initialise it you need to include the following snippet inside your endpoint initialisation section:

```php
<?php
require_once './vendor/autoload.php';
try {
    $client = new \Yoti\YotiClient('SDK_ID', 'path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem');
} catch(Exception $e) {
    // Handle unhappy path
}
```

Where:

* `YOUR_SDK_ID` is the identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard when you create your app.
* `PATH/TO/YOUR/APPLICATION/KEY_PAIR.pem` is the path to the pem file your browser generates for you, when you create your app on Yoti Dashboard.

## Profile Retrieval

When your application receives a token via the exposed endpoint (it will be assigned to a query string parameter named `token`), you can easily retrieve the user profile by adding the following to your endpoint handler:

```php
<?php
// The token can be used only once
// Reusing the same token will result to a 404 error
$oneTimeUseToken = $_GET['token'];
try {
    $client = new \Yoti\YotiClient('SDK_ID', 'path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem');
    $activityDetails = $client->getActivityDetails($oneTimeUseToken);
} catch(Exception $e) {
    // Handle unhappy path
}
```

### Available User Profile Attributes Through Getters

We have exposed user profile attributes through getters. You will find in the example below the getters available to you and how to use them:

```php
<?php
$activityDetails    = $client->getActivityDetails($oneTimeUseToken);

$rememberMeId       = $activityDetails->getRememberMeId();

$profile            = $activityDetails->getProfile();

$familyName         = $profile->getFamilyName()->getValue();

$givenNames         = $profile->getGivenNames()->getValue();

$fullName           = $profile->getFullName()->getValue();

$dateOfBirth        = $profile->getDateOfBirth()->getValue(); // DateTime Object

$gender             = $profile->getGender()->getValue();

$nationality        = $profile->getNationality()->getValue();

$phoneNumber        = $profile->getPhoneNumber()->getValue();

$selfie             = $profile->getSelfie()->getValue(); // Yoti\Entity\Image Object

$emailAddress       = $profile->getEmailAddress()->getValue();

$postalAddress      = $profile->getPostalAddress()->getValue();

$ageVerifications   = $profile->getAgeVerifications(); // array of AgeVerification object, e.g ['age_over:18' => new AgeVerification(),]

$ageOverXX          = $profile->findAgeOverVerification($xx); // AgeVerification Object (please see API Coverage for details), Where $xx is the age value, e.g 50

$ageUnderXX         = $profile->findAgeUnderVerification($xx); // AgeVerification Object (please see API Coverage for details), Where $xx is the age value, e.g 18

```

## Handling Users

When you retrieve the user profile, you receive a rememberMeId generated by Yoti exclusively for your application.
This means that if the same individual logs into another app, Yoti will assign her/him a different ID.
You can use this ID to verify whether (for your application) the retrieved profile identifies a new or an existing user.
Here is an example of how this works:

```php
<?php
try {
    $activityDetails = $client->getActivityDetails($oneTimeUseToken);
    $profile = $activityDetails->getProfile();
    $user = yourUserSearchFunction($activityDetails->getRememberMeId());
    
    if ($user) {
        // Handle login
    } else {
        // Handle registration
        $givenNames = $profile->getGivenNames()->getValue();
        $familyName = $profile->getFamilyName()->getValue();
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle unhappy path
}
```

Where `yourUserSearchMethod` is a piece of logic in your app that is supposed to find a user, given a userId.
No matter if the user is a new or an existing one, Yoti will always provide her/his profile, so you don't necessarily need to store it.

The `profile` object provides a set of attributes corresponding to user attributes. Whether the attributes are present or not depends on the settings you have applied to your app on Yoti Dashboard.

You can retrieve the sources and verifiers for each attribute as follows:

```php
<?php 
$givenNamesSources = $profile->getGivenNames()->getSources(); // array of anchors
$givenNamesVerifiers = $profile->getGivenNames()->getVerifiers(); // array of anchors
```

You can also retrieve further properties from these respective anchors in the following way:

```php
<?php
// Retrieving properties of the first anchor
$value = $givenNamesSources[0]->getValue(); // string
$subType = $givenNamesSources[0]->getSubType(); // string
$timeStamp = $givenNamesSources[0]->getSignedTimeStamp()->getTimestamp(); // DateTime object
$originServerCerts = $givenNamesSources[0]->getOriginServerCerts(); // array of X509 certificates
```

### YotiClient

Allows your app to retrieve a user profile, given an encrypted token.

## AML Integration

Yoti provides an AML (Anti Money Laundering) check service to allow a deeper KYC process to prevent fraud. This is a chargeable service, so please contact [sdksupport@yoti.com](mailto:sdksupport@yoti.com) for more information.

Yoti will provide a boolean result on the following checks:
* PEP list - Verify against Politically Exposed Persons list
* Fraud list - Verify against  US Social Security Administration Fraud (SSN Fraud) list
* Watch list - Verify against watch lists from the Office of Foreign Assets Control

To use this functionality you must ensure:
* Your application is assigned to your Organisation in the Yoti Dashboard - please see [here]('https://www.yoti.com/developers/documentation') for further information.
* Within your application please ensure that you have selected the 'given names' and 'family name' attributes from the data tab. This is the minimum requirement for the AML check.

The AML check uses a simplified view of the User Profile.  You need only provide the following:
* profile->givenNames
* profile->familyName
* Country of residence - you will need to collect this from the user yourself

To check a US citizen, you must provide two more attributes in addition to the three above:
* Social Security Number - you will need to collect this from the user yourself
* Postcode/Zip code

### Consent

Performing an AML check on a person *requires* their consent.
**You must ensure you have user consent *before* using this service.**

### Code Example

Given a YotiClient initialised with your SDK ID and KeyPair (see [Client Initialisation](#client-initialisation)) performing an AML check is a straightforward case of providing basic profile data.

```php
<?php
use Yoti\Entity\Country;
use Yoti\Entity\AmlAddress;
use Yoti\Entity\AmlProfile;

// Address of the user profile to check
$amlAddress = new AmlAddress(new Country('GBR'));
$amlProfile = new AmlProfile('Edward Richard George', 'Heath', $amlAddress);
// Perform the check
$amlResult = $client->performAmlCheck($amlProfile);

// Result returned for this profile
var_dump($amlResult->isOnPepList());
var_dump($amlResult->isOnFraudList());
var_dump($amlResult->isOnWatchList());

// Or
echo $amlResult;
```
 
## How to Run the Examples

The examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/getyoti/php/tree/master/examples). The steps required for the setup are explained below.

Please note all our examples work with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Profile sharing

* Create your application in the [Yoti Dashboard](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard/applications) (this requires having a Yoti account)
  * Set the application domain of your app to `localhost:4002`
  * Set the scenario callback URL to `/profile.php`
* Do the steps below inside the [examples folder](https://github.com/getyoti/php/tree/master/examples)
* Put `your-application-pem-file.pem` file inside the [examples/keys](https://github.com/getyoti/php/tree/master/examples/keys) folder. As Docker requires the `.pem` file to reside within the same location where it's run from.
* Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`
* Open `.env` file and fill in the environment variables `YOTI_APPLICATION_ID`, `YOTI_SCENARIO_ID`, `YOTI_SDK_ID`
  * Set `YOTI_KEY_FILE_PATH` to `./keys/your-application-pem-file.pem`
* Run the `docker-compose up -d` command and navigate to [https://localhost:4002](https://localhost:4002)
* Run the `docker-compose stop` command to stop the containers.

### AML Check

* Create your application in the [Yoti Dashboard](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard/applications) (this requires having a Yoti account)
* Do the steps below inside the [examples folder](https://github.com/getyoti/php/tree/master/examples)
* Put `your-application-pem-file.pem` file inside the [examples/keys](https://github.com/getyoti/php/tree/master/examples/keys) folder. As Docker requires the `.pem` file to reside within the same location where it's run from.
* Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in the environment variables `YOTI_APPLICATION_ID`, `YOTI_SCENARIO_ID`, `YOTI_SDK_ID`
  * Set `YOTI_KEY_FILE_PATH` to `./keys/your-application-pem-file.pem`
* Run the following commands:

```console
$ docker exec -it {container_name} bash
$ cd /usr/share/nginx/html/examples
$ php scripts/aml-check-usa.php // for AML check within the USA
$ php scripts/aml-check.php // for AML check outside the USA
```    
    
## Running the tests

PHPUnit requires `PHP 5.6` or above.
